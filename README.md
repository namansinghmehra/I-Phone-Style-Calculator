Hi, I’m Naman, and this is a clean, responsive iPhone-style calculator I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal of this project was to replicate the look and feel of the native iOS calculator, complete with smooth animations, rounded buttons, and dark mode styling — all done from scratch using only frontend technologies.
